        "Boosting, a powerful ensemble technique, excels in handling complex datasets like mine. It sequentially trains multiple models, each focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. This iterative process allows the algorithm to gradually improve its predictive accuracy, especially for instances that are difficult to classify. Unlike Bagging, which simply averages the predictions of multiple models, Boosting's targeted approach ensures that the final model is better equipped to handle complex patterns and outliers in the data. While Stacking can also combine multiple models, it often requires careful tuning and can be computationally expensive. In my specific case, Boosting's straightforward and effective approach has proven to be the most suitable for achieving optimal performance\n"
